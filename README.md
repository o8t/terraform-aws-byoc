|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cloud_name       | The name to use to identify the cloud installation. Used by Earthly during automatic installation, and to mark related resources in AWS.                 |
| subnet           | The subnet Earthly will deploy satellites into.                                                                                                          |
| ssh_public_key   | (Optional) The SSH key to include in provisioned satellites. If left unspecified, a new key is generated, and the private key is available as an output. |
| sg_cidr_override | (Optional) An override for the instance security group CIDR. If left unspecified, the rules will be generated with the CIDR of the configured subnet.    |
